Welcome,

If you made it here odds are you're beeing selected as next **Starting Finance's Flutter Engineer**!

Just one last step is required: To complete the allmighty...

# SF FLUTTER CODING CHALLENGE

In this challenge you will work with Coincap's Rest APIs to develop a Crypto Wallet.

Let's assume that our user (you!), has positions opened on many cryptos: One BTC, some ETH, A bunch of DOGEs... you get the point.

Your Goal is to develop an APP that contains a **Crypto Wallet** (You will find a mock a the end of this page), showing information about those positions: 
* Cryptos' prices and variations;
* Wallet's total value;
* Charts;
* Whatever you want, feel free to enrich the page with your personal touch. 


Features:
* Wallet's and positions' value must always have the latest price (with real time updates);
* The UI must be scalable, capable of handling many positions. 

## Step 1

## Step 2
Get yourself the latest [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) version

## Step 3
